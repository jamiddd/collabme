				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p class="company-description">CollabMe serves to connect people who want to do something
					together. It is as simple as that. It is a dedicated online platform to look for people who are
					willing to join with you on your activities; Be it work related stuff or fun and creative
					activities. Of-course one might have friends but sometimes they donâ€™t fall in the same category of
					interests that one carry.
					<br><br>
					CollabMe was started by two Computer Science graduate in an under developed area where there were
					no communities related to computer science and no scope for further learning. Learning and doing
					things along is not impossible but the world can be a much better place if everyone had someone to
					collaborate with. One had to move to a better place to look for opportunities in regards to computer
					science; We developed what we needed at that point of time to solve our own problems and we hope
					that it serves the same purpose for millions of others like us.
